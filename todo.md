Stilly need a more 'Fuzzy' full search as currently relies on an exact match to the regex.
Other than that it is just the Update endpoint that needs to be written, should be much easier than in the previous version of WhatAnime since I no longer rely on AnisongDB

It also seems that the function for syncing and combining AnilistMedia and AnisongAnime is unfunctional

Also add 'reports' table to the database.

Also add Anisong view to database, should be trivial to make around the bind table, and possibly make stuff a lot cleaner
